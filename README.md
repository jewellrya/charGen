This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Start

First, run the development server using turbo bundler:

```bash
cd apps/web
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Development

Emulate an OpenSea preview with or without an IFPS pin test.

Metamask wallet is integrated. Characters can be minted using the Mint button. This is currently on the Sepolia testnet chain and only cost gas.

The Hex button logs a table of pixel color data for the current canvas image. This is for sprite filter testing.

The UI is a just a temporary AI wireframe right now.
